# Skin-lesion-classification-using-GradCAM

We propose a novel approach for skin lesion classification using the GradCAM
(Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) technique, an interpretable and visually
intuitive tool for deep neural networks. The GradCAM method is applied to improve the
transparency and interpretability of the classification process, enabling dermatologists
and clinicians to better understand and trust the predictions made by deep learning
models. We describe the development of a convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture trained on a large and diverse dataset of skin lesion images, comprising
various types of skin conditions. The CNN model is designed to predict the likelihood
of different skin diseases, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. To enhance the
model's interpretability, GradCAM is employed to generate heatmaps that highlight the
regions of interest within the lesion images, showcasing the areas crucial for
classification decisions.
